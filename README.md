# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

# Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to conduct a Database analysis for Pewlett Hackard with detailed information on the number of future retirees from all departments currently working at the company to be able to prepare a plan to hire new staff and also to prepare a mentorship initiative. 
Using the ERD you created in this module as a reference and your knowledge of SQL queries, create a Retirement Titles table that holds all the titles of current employees who were born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955. Because some employees may have multiple titles in the database and using the ERD you created in this module as a reference and your knowledge of SQL queries, create a mentorship-eligibility table that holds the current employees who were born between January 1, 1965 and December 31, 1965.
